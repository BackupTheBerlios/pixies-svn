There's a lot to be done to support an acceptable subset of the XSL-FO
specification. However here are my priorities in no particular order:

* Support nested blocks, inheriting properties from parents elements.

* Support for external images. Initially with bitmaps support and later
  SVG support trough some 3d parts library.

* Correctly support borders. (should not be too much difficult)

* Support fo:table

* Support itemized lists

... more to come here, hints are welcome.
