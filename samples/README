Here are some XSL-FO examples. You can convert them to pdf invocating:

   $ pixies example.fo



Note: 

  The 'alternate.fo' example is broken (or better: Pixies is broken and cannot 
  renders it..) because is a multi-page document.
  Documents which use more than one page are not working because the algorithm 
  that breaks paragraph on more pages it is broken. 
  This is the very first in TODO list.
