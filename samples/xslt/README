This is an example on how perform a XSLT tranformation
directly with Pixies.

There are two file:

 * ex.xml : The XML data collection. This can be any sort of data, you 
            can define your own XML structure and you DON'T need a 
            DTD (unless you want to validate the XML data).
 * ex.xsl : The XSL stylesheet. It tells how the XML data should be
            represented.

Ex. :

pixies ex.xml ex.xsl 

This command will produce the ex.pdf document.
