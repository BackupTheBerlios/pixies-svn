If you're reading this file you have already unpacked the source 
archive. If not:

$ tar xvfz pixies-0.2.tar.gz

$ cd pixies-0.2

At this point you have to gain superuser rights:

$ su

type root password

# ./setup.py install

And Pixies it's installed. You can test if it works just typing 'pixies' 
in the command line.
